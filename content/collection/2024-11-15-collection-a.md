When the time came to choose a topic for my end-of-year project, it was evident to me that I would focus on body shaming and nothing else. Not only because I have personally experienced it here and there and have been affected by it, but also because I see it happening to others. The way people feel entitled to make comments about someone else's appearance is unacceptable, and that's why it was important for me to address this issue.

My goal was to create an interactive installation to raise awareness among body shamers about the consequences of their actions and to spread awareness. I achieved this by using three different body representations, each accompanied by a distressing story.  
Visitors can interact with these bodies and alter them as they wish. When inter- acting with one of the bodies, users will see the consequences of their actions displayed on a screen in the form of visuals. However, all of these painful inter- actions lead to a somber conclusion.
