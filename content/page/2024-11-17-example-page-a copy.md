My processfolio reflects my learning experiences during the frontend design and development course, where I worked with Nuxt.js and Tailwind CSS. Customizing Nuxt.js templates and improving the CSS structure were key focuses. I learned how to optimally structure a website and create a user-friendly layout. Tailwind CSS was a huge help because it allowed me to make visual adjustments quickly without repeating CSS rules.

A major challenge was adding interactivity to the homepage with JavaScript. For this, I watched several YouTube tutorials and used help from ChatGPT. The result looks very clean. It worked well, but sometimes the collaboration between the pages and debugging was tricky. I did learn how to navigate the code efficiently through this process.
