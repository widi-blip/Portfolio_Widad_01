Using Adobe Illustrator, I created the logo and other key brand elements, focusing on clean lines and modern typography. For promotional materials, menus, and social media graphics, I used Adobe Photoshop, combining photos and illustrations to enhance the cozy and creative feel of the brand.

One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that the branding would work well across different mediums, from print materials like menus to digital platforms like social media. It was important to keep a consistent visual style while adapting designs to fit each platform's unique requirements. Despite these challenges, the project taught me how to create a cohesive visual identity and the importance of adapting designs to various formats while maintaining brand consistency.
