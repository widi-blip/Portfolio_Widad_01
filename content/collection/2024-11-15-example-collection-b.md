During my internship at Josword, a creative agency based in Brussels, I had the exciting opportunity to collaborate on a mobility campaign for GROEN, a progressive and green political party. This project was a perfect blend of creativity, design, and sustainability, all values that align with GROEN's mission. I was tasked with designing a variety of materials to promote the party's message of green mobility and environmental awareness. From posters and flyers to stickers and even carpets, each piece had to reflect the party's commitment to a sustainable future while capturing the attention of a diverse audience.

As part of this campaign, I worked closely with the Josworld team to develop a visual identity that conveyed the party's values in an engaging and accessible way. I was responsible for illustrating vibrant, dynamic visuals that spoke to the heart of the green movement. My main focus was on creating eye-catching posters that could be used in various public spaces across the city. I incorporated elements that symbolized nature, clean energy, and sustainable transportation, all while making sure the design was bold enough to stand out in an urban environment.

Additionally, I worked on designing flyers and stickers that were distributed during events and public outreach efforts. These materials had to be visually compelling yet informative, with easy-to-read messages that resonated with the campaign's target audience. Each design was crafted with the goal of sparking conversations and promoting action towards a greener and more sustainable future.

One of the most interesting and unique aspects of this project was the creation of promotional carpets. These were placed at events and were designed to add an element of surprise and innovation to the campaign. The idea was to make the message of green mobility stand out in unconventional ways, ensuring it caught the eye and generated curiosity.
